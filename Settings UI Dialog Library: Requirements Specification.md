Settings UI Dialog Library: Requirements Specification
1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a JavaScript helper library designed to dynamically create a user interface (UI) dialog for application settings. The library will generate UI elements based on a provided JSON configuration, manage their visual presentation, and handle the persistence of setting values to and retrieval from the browser's LocalStorage.
2. Purpose

The primary purpose of this library is to simplify the creation and management of application settings UIs, allowing developers to define settings elements declaratively via JSON, with automatic rendering and data persistence upon explicit user action.
3. Scope

This document covers the initial version (V1) of the Settings UI Dialog library.

In Scope (V1):

    Dynamic generation of a modal settings dialog.

    Support for textbox, password, checkbox, radio button, and dropdown (select) UI element types.

    Display of a configurable dialog header and footer.

    Layout of settings elements in a table format.

    Persistence of setting values to and retrieval from LocalStorage.

    Application of sensible, modern, minimalist default CSS.

    Provision for overriding default CSS classes via the JSON configuration at various levels.

    Ensuring correct vertical alignment of labels and input elements within the table layout.

    The dialog will be a modal overlay, centered on the screen, with defined width/height constraints and rounded corners.

    Conditional enabling/disabling of UI elements based on the state of other elements.

    Client-side input validation for settings, including regex support for textbox and password types. Invalid fields will be marked, and saving will be disabled until all validation errors are resolved.

    Explicit "Save" and "Cancel" buttons for user control over persistence and dialog dismissal.

    Basic event hooks for dialog open/close and setting changes.

Out of Scope (V1 - Future Enhancements):

    Advanced layout options beyond a simple table.

    More complex input types (e.g., sliders, date pickers, file inputs).

    Advanced theming options beyond simple class overrides.

    Comprehensive accessibility (A11y) features beyond basic semantic HTML.

4. Functional Requirements
4.1. UI Generation (FR-UI-001)

    FR-UI-001.1: The library SHALL expose a JavaScript function (e.g., createSettingsDialog) that accepts a single JSON configuration object as an argument.

    FR-UI-001.2: The function SHALL dynamically create HTML elements to form a settings dialog based on the provided JSON configuration.

    FR-UI-001.3: The generated   SHALL be appended to the document.body.

4.2. Dialog Structure (FR-DS-001)

    FR-DS-001.1: The dialog SHALL be contained within an outer div element acting as a modal overlay.

    FR-DS-001.2: The dialog SHALL include an inner div element representing the main dialog container.

    FR-DS-001.3: The dialog SHALL support an optional header (headline) specified in the JSON configuration. If headerText is provided in the config, an h2 element SHALL be created for the header.

    FR-DS-001.4: Settings elements SHALL be arranged within an HTML table element. Each setting SHALL correspond to a tr (table row).

    FR-DS-001.5: Each tr (setting row) SHALL contain two td (table data) cells: one for the label and one for the input element.

    FR-DS-001.6: The dialog SHALL include a footer section containing "Save" and "Cancel" buttons.

4.3. UI Element Types (FR-UET-001)

    FR-UET-001.1: The library SHALL support textbox type elements, rendering as an <input type="text">.

    FR-UET-001.2: The library SHALL support password type elements, rendering as an <input type="password">.

    FR-UET-001.3: The library SHALL support checkbox type elements, rendering as an <input type="checkbox">.

    FR-UET-001.4: The library SHALL support radio button type elements, rendering as <input type="radio"> within a named group.

    FR-UET-001.5: The library SHALL support dropdown type elements, rendering as a <select> element with <option> children.

    FR-UET-001.6: If a type is not specified or is unrecognized in the JSON configuration for a setting, it SHALL default to a textbox.

4.4. Data Persistence (FR-DP-001)

    FR-DP-001.1: The library SHALL use the browser's LocalStorage for storing and retrieving setting values.

    FR-DP-001.2: Each setting's value SHALL be stored in LocalStorage using its id from the JSON configuration as the key.

    FR-DP-001.3: When the dialog is initialized, the library SHALL attempt to retrieve the stored value for each setting from LocalStorage. If a value exists, it SHALL populate the corresponding UI input element with that value.

    FR-DP-001.4: If no value is found in LocalStorage for a setting, the library SHALL use the defaultValue specified in the JSON configuration.

    FR-DP-001.5: Setting values SHALL only be saved to LocalStorage when the "Save" button is explicitly clicked by the user.

    FR-DP-001.6: Clicking the "Cancel" button SHALL discard any unsaved changes and close the dialog.

4.5. Input Validation (FR-IV-001)

    FR-IV-001.1: The library SHALL support input validation for textbox and password types by allowing a validationRegex property in the setting configuration.

    FR-IV-001.2: If a validationRegex is provided, the input value SHALL be validated against this regex.

    FR-IV-001.3: If an input value fails validation, the corresponding UI element SHALL be visually marked as invalid (e.g., with a red border, error message).

    FR-IV-001.4: The "Save" button SHALL be disabled if any input field has an invalid value. It SHALL only become enabled when all fields are valid.

4.6. Conditional Logic (FR-CL-001)

    FR-CL-001.1: The library SHALL support a enabledIf property in the setting configuration.

    FR-CL-001.2: The enabledIf property SHALL be an object specifying a dependency on another setting's id and its required value (e.g., "enabledIf": {"otherElementId": "expectedValue"}).

    FR-CL-001.3: The input element for a setting SHALL be enabled only if the dependent setting's current value matches the enabledIf condition. Otherwise, it SHALL be disabled.

    FR-CL-001.4: Changes to dependent settings SHALL dynamically update the enabled/disabled state of affected elements.

5. Non-Functional Requirements
5.1. User Interface (NFR-UI-001)

    NFR-UI-001.1 (Modal Behavior): The dialog SHALL appear as a modal overlay, covering the entire document body and preventing interaction with the underlying page content.

        This will be achieved by using position: fixed, z-index, and a semi-transparent background on the overlay element.

    NFR-UI-001.2 (Sizing and Positioning): The dialog SHALL be centered horizontally and vertically on the screen.

        It SHALL occupy a sensible width (e.g., 80% of viewport width) with a max-width (e.g., 600px).

        It SHALL occupy a sensible height with a max-height (e.g., 90% of viewport height), allowing for internal scrolling if content exceeds this height.

    NFR-UI-001.3 (Aesthetics): The dialog and its elements SHALL have rounded corners (e.g., border-radius: 10px for the dialog container, 3px for inputs).

    NFR-UI-001.4 (Styling): The default styling SHALL be modern and minimalist, primarily using grades of white and grey, avoiding overly gaudy or colorful designs.

    NFR-UI-001.5 (Vertical Alignment): Labels and their corresponding input elements within each table row SHALL be perfectly vertically aligned.

5.2. Customization (NFR-C-001)

    NFR-C-001.1 (CSS Class Overrides): The library SHALL allow users to specify custom CSS class names within the JSON configuration to override or augment the default styling. This applies to:

        The main dialog container (dialogCSSClass).

        The dialog header (headerCSSClass).

        The dialog footer (footerCSSClass).

        The "Save" button (saveButtonCSSClass).

        The "Cancel" button (cancelButtonCSSClass).

        Individual setting labels (labelCSSClass).

        Individual input elements (inputCSSClass).

    NFR-C-001.2 (Default Class Names): All default styling SHALL be applied via CSS class names (e.g., settings-dialog, dialog-header, settings-table, setting-row, setting-label, setting-input, settings-dialog-overlay, dialog-footer, save-button, cancel-button, invalid-input). No hardcoded inline styles or direct RGB values in the JavaScript for default styling.

5.3. Error Handling (NFR-EH-001)

    NFR-EH-001.1: The library SHALL gracefully handle cases where LocalStorage operations fail (e.g., due to browser restrictions, storage limits). Error messages should be logged to the console.

6. JSON Configuration Structure

The createSettingsDialog function will expect a JSON object with the following structure:

{
    "headerText": "string",             // Optional: Text for the dialog header.
    "headerCSSClass": "string",         // Optional: Custom CSS class for the header (h2).
    "dialogCSSClass": "string",         // Optional: Custom CSS class for the main dialog container.

            "defaultValue": "any",      // Optional: Default value if not found in LocalStorage.
                                        // For textbox/password: string; For checkbox: boolean; For radio: string; For dropdown: string.
            "options": [                // Required for "radio" and "dropdown" types. Array of {value: "string", text: "string"} objects.
                {"value": "option1_val", "text": "Option 1 Display"},
                {"value": "option2_val", "text": "Option 2 Display"}
            ],
            "groupName": "string",      // Required for "radio" type: Name to group radio buttons.
            "validationRegex": "string",// Optional: Regex string for "textbox" and "password" validation.
            "errorMessage": "string",   // Optional: Message to display if validation fails.
            "enabledIf": {              // Optional: Object to conditionally enable/disable this setting.
                "otherElementId": "string", // ID of the dependent setting.
                "value": "any"              // Required value of the dependent setting for this element to be enabled.
            }
        },
        // ... more setting objects
    ]
}



7. CSS Class Definitions

The library will utilize the following default CSS classes. Users can override or extend these by providing custom class names in the JSON configuration.

| Element Type | Default CSS Class | Config Property for Override | Description |
| Modal Overlay | settings-dialog-overlay | N/A (not directly configurable via JSON) | The full-screen semi-transparent overlay. |
| Main Dialog Container | settings-dialog | dialogCSSClass | The main box containing the settings UI. |
| Dialog Header | dialog-header | headerCSSClass | The h2 element for the dialog title. |
| Settings Table | settings-table | N/A | The table element holding all settings rows. |
| Individual Setting Row | setting-row | N/A | Each tr element for a single setting. |
| Label Cell | setting-label | labelCSSClass | The td element containing the setting's label. |
| Input Cell | setting-input-cell | N/A | The td element containing the input control. |
| Input Elements (general) | setting-input | inputCSSClass | Applied to all input elements (<input>, <select>). |
| Invalid Input State | invalid-input | N/A (applied by library) | Applied to inputs that fail validation. |
| Dialog Footer | dialog-footer | footerCSSClass | The div element for the dialog's bottom section. |
| Save Button | save-button | saveButtonCSSClass | The button to save settings. |
| Cancel Button | cancel-button | cancelButtonCSSClass | The button to cancel changes and close dialog. |
8. Event Hooks (In Scope for V1)

The library will provide basic event hooks:

    onOpen: A callback function executed when the dialog is displayed.

    onClose: A callback function executed when the dialog is closed (after save or cancel).

    onSave: A callback function executed when the "Save" button is clicked and settings are persisted.

    onChange: A callback function executed when any setting's value changes (before validation/saving).

These will be provided as optional properties in the main JSON configuration object.

This document will serve as the guiding specification for the development of the Settings UI Dialog library.
